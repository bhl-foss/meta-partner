WSL2 Notes: clang-native does not always build successfully when other packages
are also being built. In this case, perform 'bitbake clang-native' alone allowing
for it to complete. The root issue appears to be an OOM condition; various memory
setting limits can be used in %USERPROFILE%/.wslconfig to tune the resources allowed.
